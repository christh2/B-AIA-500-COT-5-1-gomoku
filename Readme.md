# Gomoku Project

### Introduction 
[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), also known as Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy game. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a 15×15 go board, while in the past a 19×19 board was the norm. But in our project, we'll consider a 20x20 board.

### Game rules
This is a 2-player game that is played on a 20x20 game board (called goban). We use a very
simplified version of the game. Every player plays a stone at their turn, and the game ends as
soon as one has 5 stones in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonaly) - and thus wins.

### Project purpose
The aim of this project is to implement a Gomoku Narabe game bot (also known as Wuzi Qi, Slope,
Darpion or Five in a Row), focusing on the performance of its artificial intelligence. But also, to have a bot that conforms to a communication protocol, and put our AI to the test.
